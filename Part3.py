###############  PART THREE  ################

#  Create an interactive plot which allows the user to vary the degree of a Lagrange
# interpolating polynomial (not piecewise) for a certain set of knots and evaluation points.
# The plot should show the interpolating function and the knots (like this). For
# demonstration purposes use the function from part 1, i.e. but now
# plot the interval choose a modest number of knots and centre your
# interpolant (i.e. as the degree increases and more knots are required work from the
# centre out, as seen in the video)
